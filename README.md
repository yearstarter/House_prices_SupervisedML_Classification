# House_prices_SupervisedML_Classification
## Project description
You work for a consultancy specialising in real estate: your clients include developers, agencies, and investors. Pricing is a central aspect to the business. Traditionally, it’s the domain of home appraisers to determine the value of a property, which must be executed in an unbiased way, following an official criteria to ensure that there is no bias towards neither the buyer nor the seller.

When the appraisal price is set, your clients need to decide whether they should buy the property or not. It all boils down to this simple question: is the “true value” of the property above or below the price set by the appraisal? Your consultancy wants to use data to be able to answer this question reliably and efficiently. It has acquired a dataset containing a historical register of housing prices in Ames, a small city in Iowa —the actual prices at which the properties were sold. For each house, it also contains around 80 different features, such as the area, the state of the property, whether it has a backyard or not, etc.

You were tasked with creating a model that predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics.
